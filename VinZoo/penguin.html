      <h2> Native Habitat</h2>
      <p>
        Penguins are found predominantly in the Southern Hemisphere, with species inhabiting diverse environments. They thrive in cold regions, from the Antarctic to temperate coastal areas in South America, Africa, and New Zealand. Their habitats range from ice-covered expanses and rocky shorelines to remote islands, where they nest in colonies and depend on the surrounding oceans for their primary food source, fish and krill.
