      <h2> Native Habitat</h2>
      <p>Gorillas are primarily native to the dense, tropical rainforests and montane forests of central and western Africa. These habitats provide ample vegetation for their herbivorous diet, including leaves, stems, and fruit. Gorillas are adapted to the lush, humid environment, where they build nests and live in social groups known as troops.

    <h2> Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
        
Gorillas, the largest primates, exhibit robust physical features. They have broad, muscular bodies covered in coarse black hair, and males develop a distinguishing silver-gray back as they age, earning them the nickname "silverbacks." Their faces feature pronounced brow ridges and powerful jaws, while expressive eyes convey intelligence and emotion.

  <h2> Gorilla's Diet </h2>
  <p> Gorillas are herbivores with a predominantly plant-based diet. They consume a variety of vegetation, including leaves, stems, shoots, and fruit. While their diet mainly consists of plant matter, they may occasionally eat insects or small invertebrates. This herbivorous diet provides the necessary nutrients for their large and muscular bodies in their native habitats of African rainforests and forests. </p>
