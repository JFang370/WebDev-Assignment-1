          <h2> Native Habitat</h2>
          <p>Pandas are native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, thriving in bamboo forests at high altitudes between 5,000 and 10,000 feet. These habitats consist of dense bamboo thickets, coniferous and broadleaf forests and offer pandas bamboo, their primary food, and shelter, but are endangered due to habitat loss.</p>

        <h2> Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Pandas are instantly recognizable for their distinctive appearance, characterized by black and white fur, round faces with large black patches around their eyes, and rounded bodies. They have strong jaws and teeth adapted for bamboo consumption, and their paws possess a unique thumb-like structure that aids in gripping and manipulating bamboo stems.

      <h2> Panda's Diet</h2>
      <p>Pandas are primarily herbivores with a diet centered on bamboo. They consume various bamboo species, stems, leaves, and shoots, which make up nearly 99% of their food intake. Occasionally, they supplement their diet with small mammals, birds, or fish, but bamboo remains their essential and specialized source of nutrition.</p>
